GOALS to optimise my keywords by: 

   - Use keyword research tools to find high-volume, low-competition keywords.
     - Using wordtracker entered some of my keywords, (the word Hurley is also peoples surname so some of the results were not as expected and I did not pay to upgrade for more searches).

Tiktok (Teenage customers)

I think users need to be able to purchase quickly on-line, they want the abilaty to browse different manufactuers hurleys and make informed choices. 
I think short useful videos of what's on offer on instagram and facebook would be useful. If you could get a county player for some short handy drills on tik tok that would be benefit the business. 

5.	Would your business run sales or offer discounts? How do you think your users would most like to hear about these offers?

We would advertise sales and discounts through our mail chimp news letter that users could subscribe to. Run some facebook and instagram competeitions to drive traffic. 

6.	What are the goals of your business? Which marketing strategies would offer the best ways to meet those goals?

The goal of the website is to sell a variety of hurleys to a repeating customer. That is why we store the shipping address and log the users previous orders making repeat business easy and we gain a trust worthy, efficient reputation. 

Using county hurlers and camogie players to be influenvers on facebook, insta and tik tok. We would push the womens side of the game, as the majority of sites are male domindated we would adopt a more neutral position that males and females would equally respect. 

7.	Would your business have a budget to spend on advertising? Or would it need to work with free or low cost options to market itself?

At the beginning of the business we would not have a budget for advertising but we would have a 5 year plan in place with a planned budget which increases year on year.
