## BUSINESS CONCEPTS:
In this SEO and Marketing document we will outline some of our business concepts such as: 

#### SEO implementation, including:
   o	A robots.txt file - we have added a robots.txt file to our application, which will tell search engines where they are not allowed to go on the wbsite. It shows SEO that seacrches are allowed on the files we have not included and can crawled and indexed. Having this file in our site shows quality and improves our SEO ranking. 

   o	A sitemap.xml file

   o	Descriptive meta tags have been inserted into the head of our base.file and includes a description of the site and some of the keywords that we did research on which is outlined below. We also applied some {% block meta_keywords %} at the top of other pages that were not the base.html to highlight some of the information on that particular page. 

   o	rel attributes on links to external resources were used such as the GAA and campogie assoication in our FAQ section. In our facebook link we used rel="noopener noreferrer" to improve security and privacy when opening a link in a new tab.


#### Marketing techniques, including:

o	We created a mock up Facebook business page as seen above.

o	We created an easy to sign up newsletter signup form, through MailChimp.

#### GAA Store e-commerce business model:
o	This GAA Store ecommerce site, is both B2B and B2C focused, the site itself will sell to indidvuals, families and teams but we will be also in business with the hurley makers accross Ireland that are manufacturing these hurl and ordering and collaborating with them buying in bulk etc. But the site itself is B to C based. Some of our marketing strategies are detailed below. 


## KEYWORD RESEARCH 

#### GOALS to optimise my keywords by: 

   - Use keyword research tools to find high-volume, low-competition keywords.
  
   - Using wordtracker entered some of my keywords, (the word Hurley is also peoples surname so some of the results were not as expected and I did not pay to upgrade for more searches). 
  
#### WORDTRACKER RESULTS:

- We used long-tail keywords that match customer intent such as Where to buy hurley, how to measure a hurley.
  
- We made sure keywords appeared naturally in product descriptions, category pages, and meta tags.

## CONTENT RESEARCH:
We wanted to ensure the content in our site was of high quality, well informed and reseached. We wanted it deemed hight quality for a search result.  

We did an the following exercise to brain dump some ideas and structure our content around our research: 

1.	What do your users need?

My users need a one stop shop to buy different manufacturers hurleys and accessories that will be delivered straight to their door. 

2.	What information and features can you provide to meet those needs?
I can give detailed information on how to meausure for the correct hurley. I can give them the options of different manufacturers which is our USP (unique selling point) We can create a gift message option allowing grandparent to buy and send nice messages as a gifting option. 

3.	How can you make the information easy to understand?

Hurley meausre I am using a graphic that I developed in canva outlining how exactly to meausure. If they only work in cms I have given them a handy cm to inches calculator to work out the correct size hurley with some expert advise. 

4.	How can you demonstrate expertise, authoritativeness and trustworthiness in your content?

 Expertise through the indepth knowledge shown in the product pages, the FAQ and the how to measure section.  Future we may include county players reviews and online reviews and stars.. Trustworthiness could be through our privacy policey, our robots.txt file and also our active facebook account keeping customers up to date and informed with tutoring advice which shows expertise

5.	Would there be other pages within your own site you could link to from your chosen page?

Yes we are linking the How to measure, Contact Us in our FAQ. 

6.	Are there opportunities to link back to external websites that already rank highly on Google?

Yes we are linking with the gaa and camogie association. 

7.	How can you help users discover other relevant parts of your web application?

With clear navigation and structure

## MARKETING STRATEGIES


#### Research questions and future business expansion planning: 

1.	Who are your users?

Our users are coaches, kids, adults, gift buyers, parents. 
We have got some user profiles outlined in the main readme.md document. 

2.	Which online platforms would you find lots of your users?

Mail chimp newsletter to customers 
Instagram and Facebook (parents and coaches)

3.	Would your users use social media? If yes, which platforms do you think you would find them on?

Tiktok (Teenage customers)
Instagram and Facebook (parents and coaches)

4.	What do your users need? Could you meet that need with useful content? If yes, how could you best deliver that content to them?

I think users need to be able to purchase quickly on-line, they want the abilaty to browse different manufactuers hurleys and make informed choices. 
I think short useful videos of what's on offer on instagram and facebook would be useful. If you could get a county player for some short handy drills on tik tok that would be benefit the business. 

5.	Would your business run sales or offer discounts? How do you think your users would most like to hear about these offers?

We would advertise sales and discounts through our mail chimp news letter that users could subscribe to. Run some facebook and instagram competeitions to drive traffic. 

6.	What are the goals of your business? Which marketing strategies would offer the best ways to meet those goals?

The goal of the website is to sell a variety of hurleys to a repeating customer. That is why we store the shipping address and log the users previous orders making repeat business easy and we gain a trust worthy, efficient reputation. 

Using county hurlers and camogie players to be influenvers on facebook, insta and tik tok. We would push the womens side of the game, as the majority of sites are male domindated we would adopt a more neutral position that males and females would equally respect. 

7.	Would your business have a budget to spend on advertising? Or would it need to work with free or low cost options to market itself?

At the beginning of the business we would not have a budget for advertising but we would have a 5 year plan in place with a planned budget which increases year on year.
