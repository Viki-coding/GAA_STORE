<h2>Introduction</h2>


<h2>Description - Project Purpose</h2>
Gaelic Games in Ireland is an integral part of every townland, parish, village, town, city and county in Ireland and now farther afield.  This site aims at show casing a large variety of different hurleys made by different manufactures and different materials, such as ash and bamboo and ash, to allow the customer to quickly view and purchase hurleys, sliotars and hurley grips and hurley helmets.  Currently, there are individual hurley makers or sports shops who only sell one particular type of hurley and do not show the range available in Ireland. 

One of the unique selling points it to offer next day delivery if ordered before 3pm within the republic of Ireland.  During the hurling season, players are busy with matches and training, so if you break your hurley you need a replacement quickly.  There will also be a reviews section where customers can leave reviews about their purchase.  There will be an FAQ section to highlight frequently asked questions, such as why metal bands are used.  We will have a hurley size calculator where a user can enter their height, the height to their hip and the hurley calculator will tell you what size hurley is appropriate.  The customer will be able to add items to their basket, they will be able to select the size of the particular hurley they require, a sucess message will appear when they successfully add an item to their basket. when they add to their basket a display will appear at the bottom of other items to 'bundle' other items in for a deal.  When they log on to the site, a pop up will appear offering 5% off their first order when they enter their email address. There will be mail chimp newsletter.  There will be a privacy policy.  There will be a 404 page. Once the customer has added items to their shopping cart, they will proceed to checkout section, where they will enter their payment details for stripe to process,  there will be a remember me tick box so the customer can set up an account profile where they can view their orders. During each process, success or warning messages will be displayed.

<h2>Kanban Board<h2>

I found the Kanban very helpful, it did take time to set up, it was well planned and structured. I sometimes have a tendency to go from one area and then get distracted to start fixing another area, having the Kanban board with the user stories and the tasks that I needed to perform helped me to keep a structured approach to coding. I learnt that at the end of a commit if I put "relates to #1" etc it would be documented with the task # in my project. Live link at top of readme and made public.

Hero Image I have incorporated a high-quality hero image of a hurley and helmet

Accessibility
This is a community website for everyone in the community to use. Accessibility of the site is very important.

(a) Semantic HTML elements were used to provide meaningful structure to the content.

(b) Keyboard Navigation ensures all interactive elements like the form fields and buttons are accessible via the keyboard.

(c) Using Text Alternatives using Aria labels to describe content were used to improve accessibility for screen readers.

(d) Colour Contrast: The colour pallet chosen has sufficient contrast against the background to be readable by users with visual impairments.

(e) All forms were accessible with associated labels to provide clear instruction and are navigable using keyboard.

(d) Alt attributes were used to describe any image content such as the logo and notice board image.

(e) Testing, we used WAVE a Web Accessible Evaluation Tool to analyse the page and made adjustments to the site to try to improve it. It passed the 

Wave Evaluation without errors.

Help with markdown, found this site usefule (https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and downloaded this extenstion to Visual Studio Code (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one#table-of-contents)

We gained inspiration with the READ.me by watching the video 'Creating your first README with Kera Cudmore' on CI Chanel Lead Library on YouTube and also the video with Lane-Sawyer Thompson on CI Channel on YouTube. Thanks to the on-line tutor, Oisin and Rebecca for their expertise and ability to explain some of the 'challenges' I encountered. Thanks to our very supportive and positive facilitator Kay and my Kiwi mentor Dick Vlaanderen. Also found the webinar 'Community Q&A: How to Troubleshoot with Lane-Sawyer Thompson' very helpful approach to how to view looking at the site for bugs and methodically identifying issues.
