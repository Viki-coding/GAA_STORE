    <h2>How to Measure for a Hurley</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wear your shoes or boots.</li>
        <li>Player stands nice and relaxed with their hands down by their sides.</li>
        <li>Measure using a piece of string or tape the distance from the ground to their wrist.</li>
        <li>
            This measurement in inches is the correct size hurley to choose. If you only have a centimetre measure use our handy calculator below:

        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        <strong>NOTE:</strong> If you are checking the size of an old hurley, the player should be able to hold the hurley at the top and the hurley should be just touching the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>TOP TIP:</strong> If a player is between sizes it is still better to have the hurley too small rather than too big.

                Hurling and Camogie are fast-paced games which require helmets to be worn by all players for protection.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wearing a properly fitted hurling helmet is essential for your safety on the pitch.
            </p>
            <p>
                The GAA reminds all players at all levels in all Hurling Games and Hurling Practice Sessions it is mandatory, and the responsibility of each individual player to wear a helmet with a facial guard that meets the standards set out in IS:355 as determined by the National Safety Authority of Ireland (NSAI).

            <ol>
                <li>Starting just above the eyebrow, use a measuring tape to measure the circumference of the head.</li>
                <li>Ensure the measuring tape is flat the full way around, it should sit snug but not too tight.</li>
                <li>Take note of the measurements and find the correct size of hurling helmet using the size guide.</li>
            </ol>
